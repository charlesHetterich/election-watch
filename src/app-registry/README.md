# Substrate Lambdas App Registry

This is where code related to managing the app registry will live. The v1 plan is to simply host all apps in a huggingface repository. This package will manage allowing limited access for developers to permissionlessly upload their apps to the registry, handle versioning, and handle detecting available apps for users to install onto their Substrate Lambdas client.
